This project delivers a feature rich Food Recipes Recommendation App that harnesses state of the art Natural Language Processing (NLP) and content based machine learning techniques to transform a user’s pantry list into personalized culinary inspiration. By encoding ingredients with TF IDF weighted vectors and computing cosine similarity across a meticulously curated recipe knowledge base, the system surfaces dishes that maximize ingredient overlap while encouraging gastronomic variety. Implemented with a Python–Flask micro service architecture and an aesthetically engaging HTML/CSS front end, the platform renders high resolution recipe imagery, detailed ingredient breakdowns, and step by step preparation guidance. In doing so, it enables users to minimize food waste, optimize cooking time, and broaden their gastronomic repertoire—all on commodity hardware using open source tooling.
